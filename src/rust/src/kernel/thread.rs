//! Thread Kernel Module
//!
//! This module provides a safe and idiomatic Rust interface for managing Nautilus threads.
//!
//! # Spawning a thread
//!
//! A new thread can be spawned using the [`thread::spawn`](spawn) function:
//!
//! ```
//! use crate::kernel::thread;
//!
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!    // some work here
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, the thread's handle is never used, which means that there is no way
//! for the program to learn when the spawned thread completes or otherwise terminates.
//! 
//! To learn when a thread completes, it is necessary to capture the [`JoinHandle`] object
//! that is returned by the call to [`spawn`], which provides a [`join`][JoinHandle::join]
//! method that allows the caller to wait for the completion of the spawned thread:
//!
//! ```
//! use crate::kernel::thread;
//! 
//! let thread_join_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! // some work here
//! let output = thread_join_handle.join().expect("Thread failed to join!");
//! ```
//!
//! # Configuring threads
//!
//! A new thread can be configured before it is spawned via the [`Builder`] type,
//! which currently allows you to set the name, stack size, bound CPU, and whether
//! or not the parent's virtual console is inherited for the thread:
//!
//! ```
//! use crate::kernel::thread;
//!
//! thread::Builder::new()
//!     .name("my_thread")
//!     .inherit_vc()
//!     .spawn(move || { vc_println!("Hello, world!"); });
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread-local storage
//!
//! Thread local storage is not currently implemented. It would be nice to have
//! a TLS API similar to the standard library, but using Nautilus' existing
//! thread local storage C functions.

/// - The `'static` constraint means that the closure and its return value must have a lifetime of
///   the whole program execution. The reason for this is that threads can outlive the lifetime
///   they have been created in.
///   
///   Indeed if the thread, and by extension its return value, can outlive their caller, we need
///   to make sure that they will be valid afterwards, and since we can’t know when it will
///   return we need to have them valid as long as possible, that is until the end of the
///   program, hence the `'static` lifetime.
/// 
/// - The `Send` constraint is because the closure will need to be
///   passed by value from the thread where it is spawned to the new thread. Its return value
///   will need to be passed from the new thread to the thread where it is joined. As a reminder,
///   the Send marker trait expresses that it is safe to be passed from thread to thread.
///   `Sync` expresses that it is safe to have a reference be passed from
///   thread to thread.
