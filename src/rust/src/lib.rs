// This enables the `some_result.inspect_err(...)` function,
// which makes error logging much more ergonomic. This feature
// is not strictly necessary, and we could define this method
// in our own `ResultExt` trait, but this seems likely to be
// stabilized.
#![feature(result_option_inspect)]

// cfg_accessible is SUPER UNSTABLE and its API may be changed
// or removed without warning. But we need it so that we can
// hook into "#define"s from KConfig for conditional compilation.
// Please see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64797.
